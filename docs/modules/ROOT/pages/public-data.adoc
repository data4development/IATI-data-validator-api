== API on public files

The API runs behind a load balancer, and interfaces with both the file store and the dataset information database.

At the moment, the API requires a two-step approach:

* Get dataset information about a specific publisher, dataset, or download URL.
This will include an MD5 checksum of the dataset source file.
* Download the required result format of the validation as a file, based on the MD5 checksum.
